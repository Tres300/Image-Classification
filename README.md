# Image-Classification
## Description
Data Science project to classify images using a convolutional neural network.

This project contains a notebook that attempts to classify the MNIST dataset using a convolution, max pooling, and then an MLP neural network. This is not quite a convolutional neural network but it is similar.

## Notebook
`Image_Classification.ipynb` is the notebook that contains the preprossessing, model, and classification results.

## Data Source
### MNIST dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 28 by 28 handwritten digits 0-9. The training set has 60,000 examples, and the test set has 10,000 examples.

The data was obtained via `keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`.
